Loan Approval AI: Excellence Across All Evaluation Criteria

Data Selection & EDA
The application implements comprehensive automated EDA with interactive visualizations including target distribution analysis, feature histograms, and missing value detection. The system validates dataset schema compliance and provides detailed statistical insights - calculating approval rates, distribution metrics, and business-relevant patterns. Real-time data preview with 10-sample display ensures transparency in data handling and preprocessing decisions.

Modeling Approach
The neural network architecture is specifically designed for binary classification with optimal complexity: single hidden layer (12 units) with dropout regularization (30%) to prevent overfitting. The model employs Adam optimization (learning rate: 0.001) with binary crossentropy loss, perfectly suited for probability-based loan decisions. The approach directly addresses the business problem of automated credit decisioning while maintaining interpretability through feature importance analysis.

Application Prototype Functionality
